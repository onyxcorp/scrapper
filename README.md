Hi there! Welcome to Cloud9 IDE!

To get you started, we have created a few example applications.

1) Choose the application that you want to run by selecting a language folder

2) Open the file within the folder

3) Follow the run instructions in the file's comments
    
And that's all there is to it! Just have fun. Go ahead and edit the code, 
or add new files. It's all up to you! 

Happy coding!
The Cloud9 IDE team

P.S. Oh, one more thing: to start a new project, hop on over to your 
dashboard and hit the big green button labelled "Create New Workspace."
